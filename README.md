# Complex-functions
This program maps complex input plane Z to output plane W. The particular function can be set by setting `u` to be real part of the 
function and `v` be the imaginary part of the function.

For example is `f(z) = z^2` implies `Re(f(z)) = x^2 - y^2` and `Im(f(z)) = 2xy` , set `u = x^2 - y^2` and `v = 2xy`
